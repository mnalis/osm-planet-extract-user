- benchmark some standard libxml (SAX) line-oriented XML parser
- try if we can use MCE::Grep ?
- add sample scripts to extract tags user by that user, sorted by popularity
- another (slower) script which also fetches whole elements (way/node/relation) which mention specified UIDs
  (perhaps two-step - extract changeset numbers from changesets-xxxxxx.bz2 to a file, and then fetch all those object
  ids from a file? would that be faster? more universal at least)
  That way one can see current history of all elements they ever touched (e.g. if someone else has changed them)
- benchmark other potentially faster solutions, PBF based:

- add README.md
